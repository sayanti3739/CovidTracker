# Covid Tracker

An Android App that helps in keeping track of the total number of Corona-positive patients in India, total number of people that have recovered (or discharged) and total number of deaths in India, as declared by [The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/), using REST API (as mentioned below) .

* The API source for the app is : [https://api.rootnet.in/covid19-in/stats/latest](https://api.rootnet.in/covid19-in/stats/latest)
* The Github link (to the profile) for the above mentioned source : [https://github.com/amodm/api-covid19-in](https://github.com/amodm/api-covid19-in)

Just install the app-debug.apk file to install the app on your phone and keep track of the spread of Corona in India. {P.S. Don't worry about the security warnings that your phone might show (if any); that's only because the app is not available in Google Play Store}

**Enjoy!**
